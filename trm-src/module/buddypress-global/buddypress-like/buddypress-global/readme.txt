BuddyPress Global Search allows for a global, unified search of all BuddyPress components, with a live dropdown as you type.

== Description ==

Let your members search through every BuddyPress component, along with pages and posts and custom post types of your choice, all in one unified search bar with a live dropdown of results.

Just activate the plugin, and every WordPress search input will instantly search your entire BuddyPress site, returning the results in a beautiful tabbed interface on your default Search Results template, styled automatically by BuddyPress to fit with your theme.

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of BuddyPress Global Search, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "BuddyPress Global Search" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our search plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our BuddyPress Global Search plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
