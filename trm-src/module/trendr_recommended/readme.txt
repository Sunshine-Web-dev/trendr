== Description ==

**[Related Posts by TRMBrigade](https://trmbrigade.com/wordpress/module/related-posts/?utm_source=related-posts-lite&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=pro-upgrade-rp)** will add related posts thumbnails after the post. This Related Posts Plugin allows to customize thumbnail sizes, display settings and type of relation.

By default it uses generated by WordPress thumbnail for the first image appeared in the post, that was uploaded on the server with sizes as set in Media settings. You can select between 'thumbnail' and 'medium' size options. In addition if your theme supports Post Thumbnails feature introduced in WordPress 2.9 you can specify custom thumbnail size. You can also specify post custom field name to be used as thumbnails source.

Thumbnails are arranged in columns under the post with related posts title/excerpt under each post thumbnail. Colors of background, border, text, text sizes, background on mouse over, title and excerpt length can be customized. See screenshot.

You can specify number of related posts to display, start date, categories to show on and to include, top text, style settings, default image URL. You can select type of relation - categories, tags, categories and tags, random or custom taxonomies. You can specify where to display related posts - choose page type (main or single), post type and select categories. You can turn off automatic appending to the end of post and use **&lt;?php get_related_posts_thumbnails(); ?&gt;** php tag in the Loop of your theme. Related Posts thumbnails sidebar widget is also available. You can use [related-posts-thumbnails] shortcode in the post body.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin decide which image to use as post thumbnail? =

If your theme supports WordPress Posts Thumbnail feature and post has a specified Post Thumbnail as seen on Edit Post page, when this image will be used as a post thumbnail in related posts. The size of the image is determined by plugin setting 'Post-thumbnails name'.

If your theme does not support Post Thumbnail feature or post has no assigned thumbnail, when the first image on the post will be used as a thumbnail.

= Does plugin support external images, e.g. uploaded on Flickr? =

There is no direct support of external images in the current version of the plugin. You can use custom field option. Or you can use http://wordpress.org/extend/module/generate-post-thumbnails/ or similar plugin to save external images as post thumbnails.

= What is the default image URL? =

If there are no images of the specified size in the post, or file does not exist on the server the default image will be used as a post thumbnail. You can upload your image on server and specify its URL in plugin settings.
